8/24/2014 21:55:47,,,>15m,2m-5m,No,,No,No,"For each doctrine a pilot can fly, work out a primary role for them (DPS, logi, EWAR, tackle, etc) which they'll keep ships ready for in GE- and will fly by default when e.g. an Eagle fleet is called for.

Announce desired numbers or ratios of fleet roles, and maintain fleet organization discipline so logi are in the logi wing, etc. If everyone knows the fleet needs at least 12 logi, and there are only half that many, qualified logi pilots should be able to recognize that they should get in their Scythes and move themselves into the logi wing without so much dicking around.

Use FC teams, with wing leaders / sub-FCs / whatever for EWAR and other roles distinct from DPS. This goes on to a certain extent with the separate tackle/EWAR fleets, but in practice these are formed and used as tackle fleets, with EWAR included as an afterthought and its pilots left to fly and engage independently.

Split DPS into multiple squads/wings/whatever, anchored and flying independently. Having one giant blob anchored on the FC at 20 km means pilots' ranges from the enemy vary by 40 km, in ships whose optimal range is ~50 km, and therefore half the fleet is entirely out of range. Breaking the fleet into smaller, tighter groups would give similar dispersal to protect against bombing runs while keeping a much larger fraction of the fleet in range. (The last strat op I was on, we were anchored at 20 km, and I spent a significant amount of the fight with the called primaries well outside my Ferox's targeting range, never mind the falloff.)",,No,,No,No,Yes,"I don't have a specific example in mind, but in cases where something important or sensitive has to be done in a specific way, the 'telephone game' effect of going through multiple layers of command can be disastrous. ",Yes,Yes,Yes,"Jabber (aka XMPP) is pathetically underutilized. For a start, it should be federated between all the HERO Coalition alliances; the current balkanized arrangement where people have to set up two different accounts, connect separately, etc. for Brave and TEST Jabber is ridiculous and contrary to the design principles of XMPP. There is no reason these could not be integrated, allowing pilots to have a single account, identity, server connection, etc. but get notifications and communicate with users coalition-wide.

The current steps towards having more selective and fine-grained pings are very encouraging. It seems that TEST goes much further than Brave does in using Jabber for out-of-game communication among specific groups (Predditors, White Van, etc.) and we should make a concerted effort to move towards using Jabber.

Most importantly, the Brave IT team's security policies, and even more so their attitude to users and the user experience, are disastrously bad. It is one thing to deploy such a stringent password policy to defend against implausible threat models. However, it is far worse to deploy that with a confusing and frankly terrible interface, and then when confronted with widespread frustration, failure, and complaints from less technical users in particular, to stonewall and insist nothing is wrong. This type of tone-deaf policymaking is costing us our most precious resource, newbies; it is costing us fleet participation; it is balkanizing the coalition; and it betrays an astonishing failure of oversight and effective control by leadership. These problems have been screamingly obvious to anyone who's spent half an hour in Brave Dojo, and the lack of official response beyond blaming and ridiculing the users is shameful.

Leadership should take a much firmer hand here in ensuring that the newbie experience is as straightforward and painless as possible, and brushing aside all obstacles, technical and organizational. The current IT leadership has done some things well, but their obstinate, tone-deaf insistence that there is nothing wrong is in no way compatible with an alliance claiming to stand for the newbie and take a laid-back, fun-per-hour-focused approach to Eve. To defend against far-fetched password cracking scenarios while driving away newbies is a strategic disaster.

At a higher level, it is endlessly frustrating as a line member that there is no effective or organized way to communicate with leadership, the FC team / military directorate, recon, or various other alliance functional areas. In the last few weeks I have had several cases where I wanted to report reconnaissance information, suggest a military operation, inquire about industry operations, or get involved in recon operations, and could not find a single good way to do so. There's no list of who to talk to, there are no designated chat channels, Jabber rooms, or mailing lists, and running through the list of well-known FCs I can think of offhand and trying to convo them is a pretty poor system. Emailing them is even worse; with recon in particular I may as well be talking to a brick wall.

I understand that individual people in leadership roles have full mailboxes and plenty of things to do outside of internet spaceships; however, having designated people in liaison / point-of-contact roles  for each department, clearly listed on the wiki and monitoring Jabber channels, would do wonders.",Yes,"I would, but I think we already have this and it's called the subreddit. (The forums are a bad joke, and should be purged along with all the other Draleth-ware.)

I'm unconvinced of the value of a structured survey tool; responses are inevitably going to be self-selected and of very dubious statistical value.

Questions:

Are you comfortable joining fleets? Do you feel like you can afford to lose ships in PVP?

Are you able to move around Catch reasonably safely?

Do you have a sustainable income source? If not, what have you tried, and what problems have you encountered?

Are you happy and/or comfortable with the leadership styles of the FCs?

What do you feel could be improved in fleet leadership? Do you feel your fleet role (or another role) could be handled better?",No,No,No,No,Yes,"Generally speaking, and with notable exceptions, I don't think they are.

In some ways, that's a hard question to answer, given the minimal communication we see from leadership. I couldn't say what the leadership position even is on the recent controversies revolving around TEST and Blue Ice; it seems that Blue Ice lost his ping privileges briefly, but leadership has been silent on every aspect of the matter. The same goes for the string of issues around Xenos and FAF.

Arik at least does a reasonable job of communicating about doctrines, and to a lesser extent military operations. But even there I still haven't heard what we're doing in Northern Catch, whether we're planning on taking all the Provibloc systems there, or anything like that. Obviously specific operational plans can't be disclosed, but it's absurd to not even talk generally about war aims and so forth. I suspect the Provibloc diplomats have a much better idea of what we're after than I do as a Brave line member.

I feel like our new members are poorly served by our current arrangements in Catch; every day in the Dojo I see people talking about how they can't make ISK, they can't afford to get into fleets, they can't get out of GE- station for hours on end, they can't move anything around Catch without getting blown up, etc. Some of these are problems of communication and education—solo ratting in the GE- belts is a doomed endeavor—but clearly we could be doing more there. But there are fundamental problems, too. GE- station is camped half the time, and that's a showstopper for a newbie who can't fly an interceptor. I don't think we're serving our newbies well by encouraging them to set up shop in GE-. Again, to the extent that we claim to be a newbie-oriented alliance, we need to back this up by making sure the newbie experience is a good one. I suspect it's harder for a newbie to get started now than it was for me back in Barleguet, and I'd like to see leadership addressing this seriously.

The 'stay classy' principle has been a hot-button topic lately, but I think that is for very good reason. Brave Newbies, and the principle of classiness, are the *only* reason I'm even playing Eve. I can't imagine I'm alone. The only way I want to interact with obnoxious assholes, sociopaths, or people who think 'Jew' is a verb is by shooting at them. It is disheartening to see leadership remaining silent and giving every appearance of tolerating profoundly unclassy behavior by members of leadership. And the entire concept of HR is a mockery when it's run by someone like Nicholas Aideronne who is openly dismissive of the idea of classiness and demonstrates a deep misapprehension of what the role of HR should even be, as in the last Xenos fiasco. By allowing a situation like this to continue, leadership gives it their tacit approval. Whether or not Aideronne happens to have resigned now, leadership has made it perfectly clear through their silence that they approved of the way that department was being run. And so if I had an objection to an FC or some other member of leadership, why on earth would I waste my time bringing it to someone like Aideronne?"
